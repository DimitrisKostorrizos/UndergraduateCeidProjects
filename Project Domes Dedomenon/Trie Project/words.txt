Anyone
can
use

due
training
or
even

luck

to

at

both
student

master
responded
to
a
mysterious
distress
signal
from
the
supposedly
dead
world
of
Carnelion
IV
that
specifically
called
for
Jedi
intercession
They
began
their
journey
to
the
coordinates
but
their
shuttle
was
damaged
due
to
the
planet
s
atmospheric
debris
field
and
the
two
had
to
eject
from
the
doomed
vessel
landing
below
the
Celadon
Sea
Not
too
long
afterwards
they
came
to
be
aware
of
there
being
life
on
the
planet
as
a
sky
battle
raged
over
them
and
Kenobi
returned
his
lightsaber
to
him
so
that
he
could
defend
himself
As
one
of
the
combatant
airships
began
to
fall
Skywalker
and
Kenobi
saved
its
two
person
crew
by
delaying
the
crash
The
survivors
Kolara
and
Mother
Pran
were
unaware
of
the
distress
signal
and
who
the
Jedi
were
Kenobi
was
then
able
to
use
a
mind
trick
on
Pran
to
lower
her
weapons
However
they
came
under

Kenobi
then
stopped
the

Grecker
from
shooting
at

Pran
and
Kolara
After
Skywalker
destroyed
their

Kenobi
then
pulled
their

away
Kenobi
reasoned
with
Greckeker
Kolara

that
they
need
to
get
to

As
they
made
their

they
came
across

drew
their

Kenobi
then
refused
to
accept
to
give
them
the
location

also
told
Grecker
that
Skywalker
was
not
his
son

his
Padawan
at
the
dying
request
of
his
master
Kenobi
and
Grecker
then
defended
the
airship
against
the
corpse

However
Pran
and
Kolara
took
Skywalker
with
them
and
abandoned
the
airship
Kenobi
was
then
left
behind
on
the
airship
as

destroyed
it
Kenobi

Grecker
were
then

off

Kenobi
was
then
able

use
the

to
make

then
asked

to

told
him
that

go

him
with
Grecker
after
getting
air
masks
on

Grecker
then
found
the
location
of

They
then
came
under

by
a
creature
Grecker

fired
a

Kenobi

Grecker
then
fought
until
a
masked
man
came
out
and
let
them
in
Kenobi
was
able
to
get
inside
before
Grecker
closed
the
door
The
man
Sera
then
showed
Kenobi
his
collection
of
his

Kenobi
was
then
told
that
Sera
was
the
one
who
sent
the
distress

He
then
told
Kenobi
about
his
collection
of
relics
and
how
both
the
open
and
closed
wanted
him
dead
Kenobi
then
learned
about
how
Sera
sent
the
signal
and
learned
about
both
the
Jedi
and
Sith
Kenobi
and
Sera
then
went
to
the
roof
to
watch
as
Grecker

forces
attacked
his
fortress
Despite

pleas
for

to
kill

at
the
behest
of
Supreme
Chancellor
Sheev
Palpatine
Kenobi
and
Skywalker
to
protect
the
Senator
from
future

Kenobi
sensed
his
apprentice
s
anxiety
and
warned
Skywalker
of
over
stepping
their
duties
only
to
be
told
later
of
Amidala
s
plan
to
use
herself
as
a
bait
That
night
Zam
Wesell
attempted
to
kill
the
Senator
with
venomous
kouhun
but
her
plot
was
foiled
and
Kenobi
used
her
probe

to
find
the
Wesell
Assisted
by
Skywalker
s
arrival
in
a
speeder
they
pursued
the
bounty
hunter
together
through
Coruscant
until
her
speeder
crashed
outside
a
nightclub
The
Jedi
followed
her
in
realizing
she
was
a
changeling
however
Kenobi
soon
found
Wesell
and
cut
her
arm
off
with
his
lightsaber
before
she
could
shoot
him
Before
she
could
tell
the

who
she
was

Skywalker

he
abided
by

Kenobi
then
took
the
toxic
dart
to
his
friend
Dexter

who
told
him
that
it
was
a
Kamino
saberdart
Using
Dex
s
information
about
Kamino
Kenobi
visited
the
Archives
but
he
was
unable
to
locate
the
system
When
he
asked
Jocasta
Nu
about
it
she
surmised
that
the
system
must
not
exist
since
it
was
not
in
the
archives
Unconvinced
Kenobi
visited
Master
Yoda
who
was
teaching
younglings
and
the
two
agreed
that
someone
had
erased
the
files
on

from

Archives
and
that
Kenobi
needed
to
visit
the
location
of

they
were

by
the
arrival

soon
only
a

were

The

looked

When
rumors
spread
that
the

of
the
Council
of
Neutral
Systems
Duchess
Satine
Kryze
was
secretly
building
her
own
army
to
fight
for
the
Separatist
cause
Kenobi
was
sent
to
Sundari
by
the
Jedi
Council
to
investigate
the
matter
There
he
met
Prime
Minister
Almec
and
re
encountered
his
old
friend
Kryze
who
assured
him
that
she
was
not
behind
an
attack
to
a
Republic
cruiser
Angered
at
the
accusations
she
claimed
the
Senate
was
eager
to
intervene
in
the
planet
s
affairs
before
being
corrected
by
Kenobi
who
claimed
to
be
there
on
the
Jedi
Order
s
interest
Assuaged
the
Duchess
then
took
Kenobi
for
a
walk
on
Peace
Park
and
informed
him
of
a
renegade
group
of
warriors
known
as
Death
Watch
when
a
terrorist
blew
up
the
memorial
shrine
where
Kryze
and
Kenobi
were
walking
When
Kenobi
had
the
guards
round
up
everyone
at
the
scene
a
man
fled
with
Kenobi
after
him
and
committed
suicide
instead
of
being
captured
As
the
Duchess
spoke
to
the
dying
man
she
realized
he
came
from
Concordia
and
helped
Kenobi
reach
the
moon
where
the
Jedi
Master
met
its
Governor
Pre

Kenobi
vs

Kenobi
engaging
Pre
Vizsla
in

Kenobi
went
out
to
investigate
the
mines
and
discovered
that
the
Death
Watch
was
using
one
of
the
facilities
as
a
base
Taken
hostage
by
the
Death
Watch
he
contacted
Kryze
who
freed
him
and
together
they
tried
to
escape
when
they
were
attacked
and
the
Commander
of
the
Death
Watch
arrived
Revealing
himself
to
be
Viszla
he
returned
Kenobi
s
lightsaber
and
dueled
him
with
the
Darksaber
until
he
ordered
his
warrior
to
kill
him
with
missiles
Kenobi
and
Kryze
managed
to
escape
barely
surviving
and
returned
to
Mandalore
The
next
day
Kenobi
told
the
Duchess
that
he
believed
the
Separatists
were
involved
which
only
angered
her
the
Jedi
Master
then
was
joined
by
Skywalker
so
as
to
bodyguard
her
during
her
and
other
senators
trip
to
Coruscant
onboard
the
Coronet
On
their
way
to
the
Republic
s
capital
Kenobi
took
part
of
a
heated
debate
with
the
Duchess
over
what
the
best
course
of
action
was
to
deal
with
the
conflict
until
they
took
a
little
break
Then
Skywalker
asked
him
Kenobi
of
their
past
which
Kenobi
explained
he
and
his
master
Jinn
had
been
protecting
her
during
a
year
long
dangerous
mission
during
a
civil
war
on
Mandalore
It
was
then
that
assassin
droids
were
activated
prompting
Kenobi
to
defend
Kryze
When
the
droids
were
stopped
Skywalker
reported
to
Kenobi
that
one
of
the
senators
was
a
traitor
and
Kenobi
then
devised
a
plan
to
uncover
the
traitor
s
identity
by
using
the
last
active
droid
Obi
Wan
Satine
VoT
Kryze
safely
arriving
on
Coruscant
thanks
to
Kenobi
s
help
It
turned
out
to
be
Tal
Merrik
who
took
Kryze
as
a
hostage
and
made
his
way
to
the
cockpit
to
jump
out
of
hyperspace
so
that
droid
reinforcements
could
enter
the
ship
While
Skywalker
engaged
the
droids
Kenobi
found
and
followed
Merrik
who
would
blow
up
the
ship
as
he
got
near
the
escape
pods
unable
to
make
a
move
on
the
senator
Afraid
she
might
not
see
Kenobi
again
Kryze
confessed
her
feelings
for
him
to
which
Kenobi
replied
he
would
have
left
the
Order
if
she
had
told
him
earlier
Then
Kryze
took
the
opportunity
to
escape
a
disgusted
Merrik
and
take
his
blaster
However
neither
Kenobi
nor
Kryze
made
a
move
to
stop
him
leaving
Skywalker
to
sneak
up
from
behind
and
stab
him
in
the
back
branding
himself
as
a
cold
blooded
killer
After
arriving
on
Coruscant
Kenobi
and
Kryze
reflected
upon
the
situation
and
the
Duchess
flirted
with
him
saying
his
beard
hid
too
much
of
his
handsome
face
When
Kryze
s
pleas
to
the
Senate
to
not
interfere
with
Mandalore
s
internal
affairs
went
unheard
Kenobi
reunited
with
the
Duchess
advising
her
not
to
be
rash
angering
her
Soon
enough
she
was
victim
to
another
terrorist
attack
and
barely
survived
prompting
the
Senate
to
accelerate
the
vote
with
the
Republic
deciding
to
occupate
Mandalore
Despite
Kenobi
s
plea
to

matters
in

his

were
interrupted
by
an

attack
by
General

on

Grievous
s
ships
quickly
gained
the
upper
hand
on

destroying
several
of

Upon

that
Grievous
had
sent

to
board

Kenobi
and
the

on
the

stationed
themselves
in

accompanied

after

Kenobi
was
forced
to
retreat
and
reunite
with
Onhaka
Inside
a
cave
Ohnaka
decided
to
ambush
the
men
while
Kenobi
decided
to
confront
Maul
and
Opress
With
great
skill
and
Gallia
s
lightsaber
Kenobi
violently
fought
the
pair
changing
to
Ataru
and
demonstrating
mastery
of
his
former
fighting
style
Eventually
he
injures
Opress
knee
and
cuts
his

off
However
before
Kenobi
could
continue
the
fight
Maul

pushed
him
into
another

cave
bringing
the
fight
to
an
end
Realizing
their
plan
had
failed
the
Dathomirans

another

Their
ship
however
was
shot
down
and
the
two
were
forced
to
head

fell
Kenobi
went
with

what
riches
had
fallen
from
the

but
there
were
no
signs
of

nor
Opress
leaving
Kenobi
to
doubt
their
demise
Following
the
confrontation
Kenobi
returned
to
Coruscant
where
he
explained
to
Chancellor
Palpatine
about
the
situation
regarding
Darth
Maul
but
Palpatine
dismissed
the
Maul
s
threat
saying
that
the
Jedi
needed
to
focus
on
the
Separatist
threat
despite
Kenobi
s
fears
of
the
criminal
underworld
being
a
place
where
Maul
could
flourish
Following
Maul
s
takeover
of
Mandalore
Kenobi
was
summoned
to
meet
with
Yoda

Ki

Mundi
in
the

The
two
showed
him
a

that
had

In
the
message
she
stated
that

Maul
personally
hunted
down

and
managed
to
ensure
that
the
Twilight
was
shot
down
before
it
could

After
the
Jedi
jumped
from
the
doomed

Maul
captured
the
now
dizzy
Kenobi
as
Opress
lifted
an
unconscious
Kryze
and
ordered
them
taken
back
to

Maul
realizing

he
was
interrupted
by
Admiral

told
the
Council
that
Tano
was
requested
by
Letta
Turmond
Following
Tano
s
escape
from
authorities
to
prove
her
innocence
Kenobi
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Jedi
High
Council
and
Skywalker
held
a
emergency
meeting
with
Tarkin
declaring
to
them
that
Tano
was
now
accused
of
sedition
With
Skywalker
and
Plo
Koon
doubtful
of
her
guilt
Grand
Master
Yoda
sent
the
two
to
find
her
but
Windu
attempted
to
have
Skywalker
left
out
of
the
matter
believing
having
him
involved
would
only
making
things
worse
due
to
his
emotional
bond
with
Tano
However
Kenobi
convinced
the
Council
otherwise
stating
Skywalker
knew
Tano
best
and
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
take
him
off
the
mission
After
her
capture
Kenobi
listened
to
Tarkin
as
he
informed
the
Council
that
the
Senate
requested
for
Tano
to
be
expelled
from
the
Jedi
Order
and
turned
over
to
the
Republic
military
so
she
could

impartial
judgement
Kenobi
tried
to
convince
his
fellow
Council
members
that
they
should
side
with
Tano
but
they
all
refused
to
do
so
as
they
feared
that
protecting
Tano
would
damage
their
ties
with
the
Senate
Despite
his
reluctance
to
hand
Tano
over
to
the
Republic
Kenobi
took
part
of
Tano
s
trial
in
the
Chamber
of
Judgment

the
Council
stripped
the
young
Togruta

her
rank

they
had
been
paid
by

dismissed
the
idea

During
the
last
months
of
the
war
Kenobi
and
Skywalker
were
sent
to
Utapau
to
investigate
the
mysterious
death
of
Jedi
Master
Tu
Anh
Once
they
landed
on
Pau
City
they
met
Inspector
Jen
June
who
immediately
led
the
morgue
the
Jedi
s
corpse
was
located
Immediately
the
two
Jedi
examine
her
body
Soon
enough
they
went
to
the
place
where
she
had
been
found
only
to
determine
she
had
been
hit
in
the
optic
nerve
with
a
precision
laser
dart
by
a
sniper
As
they
found
the
sniper
s
position
they
found
slime
on
the
floor
and
interrogated
the
building
s
owner
Garri
from
whom
the
two
Jedi
learned
of
the
involvement
of
MagnaGuards
Later
they
asked
Inspector
June
to
analyze
the
slimy
substance
she
told
them
it
was
the
secretion
of
an
Amani
s
skin
and
added
that
the
Governor
Torul
Blom
wanted
to
see
them

Kenobi
and
Skywalker
speaking
to
Inspector
June
Though
the
Governor
asked
them
to
leave
Utapau
Kenobi
and
Skywalker
persevered
and
rented
two
dactillions
to
go
to
the
city
s
lower
levels
and
talk
to
the
leader
of
an
Amani
tribe
there
Told
that
an
Amani
outcast
had
been
seen
entering
a
cave
not
far
from
there
Kenobi
thanked
him
and
he
and
Skywalker
went
to
the
cave
where
they
found
the
MagnaGuards
leading
them
to
suspect
of
a
Separatist
conspiracy
Despite
some
resistance
they
managed
to
get
information
from
the
droids
that
showed
them
the
involvement
of
the
Sugi
and
went
to
see
Inspector
June
once
again
After
she
identified
the
Amani
as
coming
from
the
plain
Kenobi
contacted
the
Council
to
inform
them
of
their
findings
and
later
attended
together
with
Skywalker
attended
the
funeral
of
Tu
Anh
Soon
after
they
reached
the
Amani
settlement
they
had
been
looking
for
only
for
their
dactillions
to
be
killed
and
for
the
Amani
to
scatter
in
every
direction
during
the
ensuing
confrontation
leaving
Skywalker
and
Kenobi
to
follow
the
tracks
of
one
that
appeared
to
be
their
leader
During
the
hunt
Skywalker
mentioned
Tano
for
the
first
time
since
her
departure
and
Kenobi
asked
if
he
wanted
to
talk
about
it
yet
Skywalker
refused
Kenobi
then
suggested
for
them
to
set
up
a
camp
and
rest
However
he
insisted
on
the
subject
prompting
Skywalker
to
tell
Kenobi
he
missed
Tano
and
to
voice
his
anger
at
the
High
Council
for
turning
its
back
on
her
In
response
Kenobi
asserted
that
it
had
been
Tano
s
decision
to
leave
and
that
she
had
allowed
her
emotions
to
cloud
her
judgement
something
against
the
Jedi
way
Then
Kenobi
suggested
him
to
rest
but
Skywalker
declined
so
that
he
could
keep
the
first
watch
Finally
he
questioned
Kenobi
on
what
would
happen
if
he
had
turned
out
to
be
a
major
disappointment
but
Kenobi
wanted
to
believe
it
would
never
happen

they
both
fell
asleep

were
captured
by
a
group
of
Sugis
led
by
Chong
who
brought
them
before
Endente
as
Kenobi
told
Chong
of
their
intention
to
buy
weapons
However
they
learned
Endente
was
in
fact
selling
a
kyber
crystal
and
Skywalker
prompted
him
to
show
it
before
they
made

The
two
Jedi
were
then
brought
to
the

Once

a
duel
Though
Dooku
managed
to
gain
the
upper
hand
and
knocked
Kenobi
out
cold
Skywalker
was
able
to
defeat
the
Sith
Lord
and
subsequently
executed
him
at
Palpatine
s
urging
He
then
rescued
Kenobi
carrying
him
until
he
woke
up
when
they
were
hanging
in
an
elevator
As
they
got
out
of
there
and
ran
through
hallway
Grievous
had
them
trapped
in
a
ray
shield
and
brought
to
the
Invisible
Hand
s
control
room
The
cyborg
General
personally
taunted
them
giving
R
D
enough
time
to
free
them
and
for
Kenobi
and
Skywalker
to
confront
Grievous
The
General
however
escaped
in
an
escape
pod
and
forced
the
two
Jedi
to
pilot
the
ship
and
land
on
Coruscant
as
safely
as
they
could
Following
the
ordeal
they
escorted
the
Chancellor
to
the
Senate
building
where
they
separated
with
Kenobi
going
back
to
Jedi
Temple
to
report
to
the
Council
Council
RotS
Kenobi
on
the
Jedi
Council
Later
Kenobi
attended
another
meeting
concerning
the
reports
on
the
Outer
Rim
sieges
including
Saleucami
s
fall
and
the
move
of
Quinlan
Vos
troops
to
Boz
Pity
At
the
end
of
the
session
he
met
with
Skywalker
and
told
him
to
be
careful
with
Palpatine
and
that
Palpatine
had
requested
his
presence
for
unknown
reasons
Soon
enough
Kenobi
and
the
Council
were
made
aware
that
the
Chancellor
had
Skywalker
appointed
as
his
Personal
Representative
on
the
Jedi
Council
though
the
Council
approved
of
the
appointment
they
denied
Skywalker
the
rank
of
Jedi
Master
During
the
same
meeting
Kenobi
discussed
the
importance
of
Kashyyyk
prompting
Master
Yoda
to
assist
the
Wookiees
himself
At
the
end
of
the
meeting
Kenobi
acknowledged
to
Skywalker
that
his
appointment
had
been
accepted
so
that
on
behalf
of
the
Council
Skywalker
could
spy
on
the
Chancellor
Later
before
Yoda
s
departure
to
Kashyyyk
Kenobi
conferred
with
Windu
and
Yoda
of
Skywalker
s
reluctant
compliance
on
his
task
when
he
heard
of
Windu
s
distrust
of
the
Jedi
Knight
and
Yoda
s
doubts
about
the
prophecy
of
the
Chosen
One
Obiwanshoots
Kenobi
shoots
Grievous
with
his
own
blaster
Following
the
Chancellor
s
disclosure
of
General
Grievous
location
on
Utapau
to
Skywalker
who
then
passed
it
onto
the
Council
Kenobi
was
sent
to
capture
the
fugitive
General
Before
parting
though
Skywalker
apologized
to
Kenobi
who
told
him
that
he
needed
patience
and
that
he
would
soon
become
a
master
Then
the
Jedi
Master
departed
for
Utapau
where
he
managed
to
sneak
up
on
the
Separatists
with
help
of
a
varactyl
Boga
and
confront
Grievous
personally
The
cyborg
then
challenged
Kenobi
in
lightsaber
combat
but
the
Jedi
managed
to
cut
two
of
Grievous
arms
the
General
gained
the
upper
hand
until
Kenobi
s
battalion
arrived
and
engaged
the
droids
protecting
Grievous
As
battle
intensified
Grievous
escaped
with
Kenobi
chasing
him
at
the
cost
of
losing
his
lightsaber
temporarily
to
a
landing
platform
where
he
finally
killed
Grievous
with
a
blaster
after
almost
being
kicked
off
the
platform
With
his
long
time
rival
slain
at
last
Kenobi
headed
off
to

troops

find
that

to

refused

and
requested
that

vetoed
the

expressed
that
Skywalker

that
he
did

As

Vader
accused

the

stated

to

she

Within

Kenobi
visited
the

of

Skywalker
Lars
mother
of
Anakin
and
spoke
of
how
he
was
sad
for
what
had
happened
to
her
once
innocent
and
promising
young
son
To
conceal
his
identity
he
would
once
again
use
the
alias
of
Ben

as
he
had
done
during

Clone
Wars
and
forfeited
the
use

years
however
he
struggled

he

years
battling
monotony

inactivity
and
gained
the
reputation
of
being
somewhat
of

At
some
point
Kenobi
would
be
forbidden
from

feared

of

Kenobi
wrote
about
how
he
stopped

s
men
from
collecting
their
water
tax
on
the
local
farmers
during

eight
years
into

He
kept
Jabba
s
thugs
from
extorting
the
Lars
family
into
paying
their
water
tax
following
his
subtle
use
of
the
Force
to
cause
the
thugs
firearms
to
misfire
so
that
wouldn
t
harm
townspeople
he
decided
not
to
go
into
town
anymore
That
same
night
he
sensed
Skywalker
to
be
in
danger
for
the
boy
had
gone
to
take
the
water
back
from
Jabba
s
men
and
give
it
back
to
the
farmers
Kenobi
went
to
their
encounter
but
blew
their
vehicle
s
lights
with
the
Force
to
hide
his
identity
and
proceeded
to
disable
all
of
Jabba
s
henchmen
with
the
Force
One
of
them
became
startled
and
pushed
Skywalker
to
the
ground
causing
him
to
hit
his
head
and
pass
out
Once
Kenobi
handled
all
the
thugs
he
carried
Skywalker
to
the
Lars
homestead
and
left
before
he
woke
up
Luke
s
courage
assured
Kenobi
that
it
wasn
t
the
end
of
the
Jedi
and
renewed
his
up
until
then
waning
hope
A
year
later
the
Great
Drought
had
ended
and
Kenobi
found
himself
observing
a
young
Luke
piloting
a
T
skyhopper
through
Beggar
s
Canyon
Kenobi
noted
how
similar
Luke
was
to
his
father
Anakin
and
expressed
worry
at
the
prospect
While
attempting
to
impress
his
friends
with
an
ostentatious
maneuver
through
the
canyon
Luke
badly
damaged
the
Skyhopper
and
was
subsequently
grounded
from
flying
by
his
uncle
Kenobi
feeling
sympathy
for
the
boy
took
a
job
protecting
a
Jawa
sandcrawler
that
had
been
experiencing
troublesome
raids
by
Tusken
Raiders
That
night
Kenobi
meditated
outside
of
the
sandcrawler
communing
with
Qui
Gon
and
expressing
his
hope
in
Luke
s
abilities
Soon
the
Tusken
Raiders
arrived
and
Kenobi
able
to
easily
dispatch
the
party
with
a
disarmed
raider
s
Gaderffii
stick
He
used
whatever
payment
he
earned
from
the
job
to
hire
the
Jawa
s
to
deliver
the
necessary
parts
to
fix
the
Skyhopper
At
a
droid
auction
at
an
unidentified
outpost
Luke
received
the
the
parts
Kenobi
had
provided
for
him
Luke
believed
the
parts
had
been
a
gift
from
his
uncle
and
thanked
Owen
as
he
eagerly
rushed
back
home
Deriving
pleasure
from
the
boys
enthusiasm
Kenobi
grinned
fondly
as
he
observed
from
behind
a
nearby
tent
Later
that
day
in
his
hut
Kenobi
was
cooking
dinner
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
Owen
Owen
had
put
two
and
two
together
and
sternly
demanded
that
Kenobi
have
no
part
in
his
family
s
life
He
had
brought
back
the
box
of
tools
that
he
presumably
confiscated
from
Luke
and
dumped
it
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
Kenobi
responded
back
with
several
snarky
replies
before
finally
relenting
and
saying
he
that
he
only
ever
wanted
to
help
Owen
continued
to
berate
him
calling
him
dangerous
and
troublesome
As
Owen
departed
Kenobi
regretfully
admitted
to
himself
that
danger
did
in
fact
seemed
to
follow
him
But
he
steeled
his
resolve
and
claimed
that
no
danger
would
come
to
the
young
Skywalker
boy
as
long
as
he
lived
Coincidentally
Jabba
the
Hutt
chose
this
time
to
send
a
Wookiee
bounty
hunter
Black
Krrsantan
after
Owen
who
he
believed
was
responsible
for
roughing
up
his
tax
collectors
during
the
Great
Drought
The
next
day
Owen
had
a
change
of
heart
and
himself
purchased
a
box
of
parts
He
searched
through
the
Lars
homestead
looking
for
Luke
hoping
to
fix
the
Skyhopper
with
the
boy
as
a
way
to
apologize
for
his
coarse
actions
the
previous
day
However
he
was
ambushed
by
Black
Krrsantan
and
kidnapped
Luke
in
childish
defiance
was
running
away
from
home
He
made
it
a
short
distance
out
before
sensing
likely
through
the
Force
that
something
had
gone
awry
at
the
homestead
Back
home
he
encountered
a
wounded
Beru
who
informed
him
about
what
had
transpired
and
warned
him
to
stay
home
She
ran
out
of
the
house
armed
with
a
rifle
leaving
Luke
with
the
discarded
pile
of
tools
Owen
had
earlier
dropped
While
meditating
in
the
Dune
Sea
among
a
herd
of
Banthas
Kenobi
felt
a
disturbance
in
the
Force
He
traversed
the
side
of
a
rocky
mountain
before
finding
Krrsantan
beating
Owen
In
the
ensuing
conflict
Kenobi
was
trapped
under
a
mesh
of
stun
net
that
was
dispatched
by
the
Wookiee
Krrsantan
then
knocked
Owen
off
the
mountain
who
quickly
grabbed
hold
onto
a
protrusion
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
Kenobi
escaped
the
net
and
stunned
the
Wookiee
sprinting
over
to
Owen
to
grab
him
back
up
However
Krrsantan
intervened
and
threw
an
enormous
bolder
at
Kenobi
Kenobi
used
his
lightsaber
to
split
the
rock
in
two
also
blinding
Krrsantan
in
one
eye
during
the
process
The
debris
from
the
rock
crashed
into
Owen
s
ledge
and
he
nearly
fell
if
not
for
Kenobi
s
use
of
the
Force
Kenobi
held
Owen
in
place
using
the
Force
before
losing
focus
as
a
result
of
Krrsantan
s
constant
attacks
Owen
fell
but
was
deftly
saved
by
Luke
who
used
the
repaired
Skyhopper
s
turret
to
break
Owen
s
fall
Kenobi
then
used
this
opportunity
to
disarm
the
Wookiee
who
plunged
off
the
side
of
the
mountain
He
did
not
die
however
and
escaped
off
world
to
escape
Jabba
s
wrath
Owen
reunited
with
Luke
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
held
the
boy
in
deep
embrace
He
casted
a
knowing
glance
up
toward
Kenobi
who
looked
on
in
triumph
There
were
no
words
of
thanks
exchanged
between
Owen
and
Kenobi
but
Kenobi
was
simply
happy
to
see
the
family
reunited
Kenobi
then
returned
to
his
family
which
was
what
he
fondly
called
his
herd
of
Banthas
Among
them
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
to
see
Luke
s
Skyhopper
soaring
off
into
the
sunset

Twin

Kenobi
prepares
to
face
Maul
one
last
time
In
BBY
Maul
arrived
on
Tatooine
in
search
of
Kenobi
following
his
vision
of
the
twin
suns
Unable
to
successfully
trace
him
Maul
used
a
Sith
holocron
to
lure
Ezra
Bridger
there
hoping
the
young
Jedi
s
pain
would
be
enough
to
draw
Kenobi
out
Kenobi
found
Ezra
unconscious
in
the
Dune
Sea
and
sheltered
him
from
the
storm
When
Ezra
regained
consciousness
he
alerted
Obi
Wan
of
Maul
s
presence
Kenobi
calmly
replied
that
he
knew
of
it
all
and
that
he
didn
t
go
into
hiding
unprepared
He
told
Ezra
that
it
was
Ezra
s
responsibility
to
help
the
Rebellion
not
to
handle
Maul
That
burden
fell
upon
Kenobi
himself
Soon
thereafter
Maul
arrived
seething
with
rage
upon
seeing
his
old
rival
after
so
many
years
Kenobi
sent
Bridger
off
on
a
dewback
toward
Maul
s
ship
which
Bridger
would
use
to
fly
off
world
back
to
Atollon
Maul
mocked
Kenobi
s
lackluster
living
conditions
and
wondered
out
loud
whether
it
would
be
more
cruel
to
simply
leave
Kenobi
to
what
Maul
believed
was
a
life
of
misery
and
squalor
But
rather
than
responding
with
mockery
in
turn
as
he
might
have
in
his
younger
years
Kenobi
calmly
and
succinctly
explained
to
Maul
that
the
former
Sith
Lord
in
fact
had
even
less
because
he
defined
himself
by
his
empty
desires
to
kill
possess
and
dominate
This
infuriated
Maul
who
ignited
one
of
the
blades
of
his
saberstaff
and
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
Kenobi
s
small
campfire
showering
it
with
sand
and
putting
it
out
Maul
then
began
to
speculate
on
his
old
nemesis
s
reasons
for
being
on
Tatooine
and
quickly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
Kenobi
was
there
to
protect
someone
Stirred
to
action
by
the
threat
of
Maul
to
Luke
Kenobi
ignited
his
lightsaber
and
assumed
his
traditional
Form
III
stance
As
Maul
tightened
his
grip
on
his
own
saber
and
ignited
his
second
blade
Kenobi
shifted
his
stance
to
the
one
used
by
his
old
master
Qui
Gon
during
the
duel
on
Naboo
in
the
Theed
power
generator
Maul
dies
but
for
real
this
time
Maul
dies
in
Kenobi
s
arms
Maul
noted
Kenobi
s
change
in
stance
and
after
a
few
tense
moments
attacked
He
crossed
blades
with
Kenobi
twice
before
attempting
to
hit
him
with
the
same
hilt
strike
that
had
allowed
him
to
kill
Qui
Gon
However
Kenobi
had
evidently
anticipated
this
and
he
struck
down
at
Maul
s
hilt
as
Maul
struck
upwards
bisecting
Maul
s
lightsaber
and
carving
a
lethal
laceration
into
the
former
Sith
Lord
s
chest
Maul
dropped
his
ruined
weapon
and
collapsed
to
one
knee
but
Kenobi
caught
him
before
he
could
fall
to
the
ground
and
held
him
As
Maul
laid
dying
he
asked
Kenobi
whether
the
person
whom
he
was
protecting
was
the
Chosen
One
the
one
prophesied
to
destroy
the
Sith
Kenobi
at
that
point
of
the
opinion
believed
that
Vader
would
never
turn
from
the
dark
side
replied
that
he
was
Maul
appeared
to
take
some
modicum
of
comfort
from
this
knowledge
seemingly
certain
that
he
and
Kenobi
would
ultimately
be
avenged
Kenobi
then
paid
his
last
rites
to
Maul
and
traveled
via
dewback
to
the
Lars
Homestead
Upon
arriving
there
he
heard
Beru
Whitesun
Lars
calling
to
Luke
and
saw
the
teenager
running
back
home
against
a

told

told
him
that

brought
about

fall

also
explained

showed
him
Organa

message
asking
him
to

then
asked

to
join
him
on
his
trip
to
the
planet
to
learn
the
ways
of
the
Force
but
the
young
man
refused
saying
that
he
was
needed
back
on
the
farm
and
offered
to
take
him
to
Anchorhead
On
their
way
to
the
city
the
two
then
discovered
that
stormtroopers
were
in
the
desert
looking
for
the
two
droids
and
Skywalker
headed
back
home
despite
Kenobi
s
warning
not
to
Kenobi
then
waited
for
Skywalker
to
come
back
and
arranged
a
small
funeral
pyre
for
all
the
Jawas
killed
by
the
Empire
s
soldiers
It
was
at
this
time
that
he
was
met
by
the
spectre
of
Jinn
who
offered
him
counsel
When
Skywalker
returned
the
young
man
agreed
to
go
with
him
to
Alderaan
and
be
trained
as
a
Jedi
Afterwards
the
four
went
to
Mos
Eisley
where
they
entered
a
cantina
to
search
for
a
pilot
There
they
found
the
Corellian
smuggler
Han

Kenobi
s
communion
with
Qui
Gon
was
successful
as
Kenobi
did
not
vanish
completely

became

Force
spirit
As
he
did
he
felt
past

collide
seeing
the
eventual
death
of
Solo
on
Starkiller
Base
and
his
apprentice

Using

able
to
guide

during
the
Battle
of
Yavin
so
that
he
could
successfully
destroy
the
Death
Star
with
proton
torpedoes
About
five
days
later
the
spirit
of
Kenobi
would
go
to
Dagobah
where
he
would
visit
Yoda
regarding
Skywalker
Kenobi
listened
as
Yoda
explained
that
Leia
was
by
far
the
best
candidate
to
pick
up
the
mantle
of
Jedi
as
Luke
was
impetuous
headstrong
unruly
and
inattentive
like
Anakin
Nevertheless
Kenobi
remained
steadfast
in
his
resolve
that
Luke
be
trained
and
was
successful
in
gaining
Yoda
s
approval
to
bring
the
boy
to
him
When
Skywalker
was
about
to
confront
Darth
Vader
in
the
weapons
factory
Alpha
on
the
assault
of
Cymoon
Kenobi
reached
out
to
Skywalker
through
the
Force
and
told
him
to
run
Later
while
Luke
was
stationed
above
Vrogas
Vas
he
was
attacked
by
Vader
and
crash
landed
near
an
abandoned
Jedi
Temple
he
had
read
about
in
one
of
Kenobi
s
journals
however
while
searching
for
something
to
use
in
the
temple
he
was
contacted
by
Kenobi
s
voice
which
told
him
to
abandon
the
place
as
he
did
not
believe
Luke
was
ready
As
Luke
asked
how
he
should
get
ready
he
was
attacked
and
captured
by
General
Karbin
s
stormtroopers
When
Vader
entered
the
temple
Kenobi
called
out
to
him
stating
that
Luke
was
the
Chosen
One
and
once
again
expressed
his
regret
for
Vader
s
fall
Vader
dismissed
Kenobi
s
presence
as
a
delusion
Three
years
later
Kenobi
would
reappear
to
Luke
on
the
ice
planet
of
Hoth
where
he
instructed
Skywalker
to
go
to
the
Dagobah
system
to
seek
out
Kenobi
s
former
master
Yoda
for
further
Jedi
training
Yoda
once
again
expressed
doubts
concerning
Skywalker
still
believing
him
to
be
too
old
impatient
and
reckless
as
much
as
he
had
anger
in
him
like
his
father
once
had
However
Kenobi
reminded
Yoda
that
he
had
been
once
similar
to
Luke
back
when
Yoda
taught
him
When
Skywalker
received
a
vision
of
his
friends
in
trouble
on
the
Cloud
City
of
Bespin
Skywalker
rushed
to
aid
them
Kenobi
warned
him
that
he
was
at
a
crossroads
and
that
his
abilities
were
what
the
Emperor
wanted
Kenobi
didn
t
want
to
lose
Skywalker
to
the
Emperor
the
way
he
had
lost
Vader
He
also
told
the
Jedi
apprentice
that
if
he
was
to
face
Darth
Vader
he
would
do
it
alone
as
he
couldn
t
interfere
Finally
Kenobi
gave
Skywalker
some
final
advice
in
that
he
shouldn
t
give
into
hate
for
it
led
to
the
dark
side
As
Skywalker
departed
from
Dagobah
Kenobi
was
worried
that
the
Jedi
may
have
lost
their
last
hope
only
for
Yoda
to
remind
him
of
Luke
s
sister
Leia
Organa
Kenobi
and
Luke
Chatting
Kenobi
recounting
to
Luke
about
Anakin
Skywalker
s
seduction
to
the
Dark
Side
About
a
year
later
he
reappeared
after
the
death
of
Yoda
to
explain
why
he
did
not
tell
Luke
the
truth
about
his
father
Though
Luke
wanted
to
believe
that
there
was
still
good
in
his
father
echoing
Padm
s
belief
from
twenty
three
years
ago
Kenobi
no
longer
held
that
belief
He
told
Luke
that
he
must
face
his
destiny
by
confronting
Vader
once
again
When
Luke
asked
the
meaning
of
Yoda
s
final
words
there
is
another
Skywalker
Kenobi
confessed
that
Leia
was
Luke
s
sister
and
that
they
had
been
hidden
from
each
other
to
keep

In
his
youth
the
loyal
and
dedicated
Obi
Wan
Kenobi
possessed
a
dry
sense
of
humor
and
sarcastic
wit
Yoda
said
that
he
sensed
Qui
Gon
Jinn
s
defiance
in
him
and
Jinn
himself
reflected
upon
Kenobi
s
considerable
knowledge
and
potential
he
also
considered
his
Padawan
a
lot
wiser
than
him
if
somewhat
headstrong
Often
seen
wise
beyond
his
years
his
humble
and
soft
spoken
demeanor
belied
his
warrior
prowess
Despite
his
numerous
complaints
during
flight
he
was
also
a
skilled
pilot
In
many
ways
he
represented
the
strength
of
the
old
Jedi
Order
steadfast
selfless
and
modest
His
later
skill
at
resolving
disputes
without
a
single
battle
would
earn
him
the
sobriquet
The
Negotiator
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
General
Grievous
Over
time
Kenobi
lost
some
of
his
youthful
audacity
and
assumed
the
role
of
a
more
cautious
and
conservative
mentor
to
Anakin
Skywalker
who
was
in
many
ways
his
opposite
in
personality
Kenobi
carefully
measured
his
actions
in
any
situation
garnering
him
the
aforementioned
nom
de
guerre
Kenobi
was
also
known
to
be
an
accomplished
storyteller
While
hiding
in
the
Jundland
Wastes
in
his
later
years
he
appeared
as
a
kindly
and
eccentric
old
hermit
or
in
Owen
Lars
words
That
wizard
is
just
a
crazy
old
man
to
those
not
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
Jedi
In
his
final
days
Kenobi
retained
his
traits
of
patience
and
foresight
as
well
as
gaining
some
of
the
boldness
reminiscent
of
his
youth
Kenobi
often
thought
out
plans
and
strategies
rather
than
leaping
into
action
He
would
usually
place
his
hand
on
his
chin
or
stroke
his
beard
as
he
thought
This
was
a
common
trait
of
the
Jedi
Master
one
that
his
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
did
not
practice
very
often
He
sometimes
mentally
repeated
the
Jedi
Code
to
calm
himself
Kenobi
s
respect
for
the
lives
of
others
led
him
to
emerge
from
hiding
to
save
Ezra
Bridger
and
the
C
series
astromech
droid
Chopper
from
succumbing
to
the

of

Kenobi
then
reproved
Ezra
for
succumbing
to
Maul
s
manipulation
and
counselled
the
young
rebel
to
return
to
his
place
with
the
rebellion
Despite
not
hating
Maul
Kenobi
was
prepared
to
fight
and
kill
him
in
self
defense
After
mortally
wounding
Maul
Kenobi
comforted
the
former
Sith
and
assured
him
that
he

MR
Obi
wan
Kenobi
s
third
and
last
lightsaber
Kenobi
was
a
very
capable
lightsaber
duelist
one
of
the
greatest
swordsmen
of
his
time
Throughout
his
training
years
he
had
learnt
several
forms
of
lightsaber
combat
especially
Form
III
In
contrast
to
the
aggressive
dueling
styles
of
his
master
Qui
Gon
Jinn
and
his
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
Kenobi
s
combat
style
was
mainly
defensive
though
he
would
use
aggressive
attacks
when
pressed
He
faced
some
of
the
most
dangerous
people
in
the
galaxy
such
as
the
deadly
Sith
Lord
Darth
Maul
and
infamous
Jedi
Hunter
General
Grievous
respectively
the
latter
of
whom
he
fought
on
at
least
seven
occasions
Though
he
lost
to
the
cyborg
in
three
of
their
encounters
the
first
fifth
and
sixth
he
was
able
to
survive
every
time
without
any
serious
injury
He
was
able
to
duel
Grievous
to
a
draw
in
their
third
and
fourth
encounters
and
was
able
to
overpower
him
in
their
second
duel
and
ultimately
killed
him
in
the
final
round
However
it
should
be
noted
that
Kenobi
ultimately
killed
Grievous
with
a
blaster
rather
than
his
lightsaber
Although
Kenobi
usually
used
only
one
lightsaber
he
also
seemed
to
have
been
well
versed
in
the
art
of
Jar
Kai
which
was
perhaps
most
prominently
displayed
during
his
duel
with
Darth
Maul
and
Savage
Opress
in
which
he
wielded
both
his
own
lightsaber
and
the
lightsaber
of
the
deceased
Adi
Gallia
His
mastery
of
dual
blade
combat
allowed
him
to
hold
his
own
against
both
the
Sith
brothers
and
he
even
managed
to
break
Opress
s
left
knee
and
sever
his
left
arm
The
duel
ultimately
ended
as
a
stalemate
when
Maul
used
his
Force
powers
to
briefly
incapacitate
Kenobi
giving
the
brothers
time
to
escape
Kenobi
also
situationally
and
somewhat
less
successfully
used
Jar
Kai
against
General
Grievous
and
Cad
Bane
respectively
He
was
also
capable
of
using
his
lightsaber
to
ground
Force
lightning
as
he
demonstrated
against
Dooku
on
Geonosis
Kenobi
was
also
able
to
defeat
his
former
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
then
Darth
Vader
in
an
epic
duel
on
Mustafar
Making
use
of
his
staunch
Form
III
defense
throughout
the
fight
Obi
Wan
was
eventually
able
to
exploit
Vader
s
aggressive
nature
and
dismembered
the
hate
filled
Sith
Lord
when
he
recklessly
jumped
towards
him
Decades
later
he
defeated
his
old
nemesis
Maul
within
seconds
despite
the
former
Sith
Lord
having
demonstrated
the
ability
to
hold
an
advantage
against
three
Inquisitors
simultaneously
and
duel
his
master
Darth
Sidious
for
a
short
time
A
short
time
later
during
his
rematch
with
Vader
on
the
first
Death
Star
he
proved
formidable
enough
to
hold
his
own
against
the
Dark
Lord
for
a
short
time
However
Vader
s
cautious
but
relentless
assault
ultimately
overwhelmed
Kenobi
s
defenses
and
he
was
forced
to
begin
retreating
Ultimately
he
chose
to
become
one
with
the
Force
rather
than
continue
the
fight
and
in
doing
this
he
taught
both
of
his
Skywalker
students
one
final
lesson
Force
powersEdit
The
Force
is
what
gives
a
Jedi
his
power
It
s
an
energy
field
created
by
all
living
things
It
surrounds
us
and
penetrates
us
It
binds
the
galaxy
together

Though
Kenobi
focused
largely
on
lightsaber
combat
he
was
also
very
skilled
and
powerful
in
use
of
the
Force
He
was
trained
in
the
use
of
the
mind
trick
making
use
of
it
whenever
he
wanted
to
avoid
physical
confrontations
He
was
also
able
to
use
the
Force
to
tame
control
and
lead
a
group
of
angry
gutkurrs
on
Ryloth
As
befitted
a
Jedi
Kenobi
was
adept
at
concealing
his
feelings
in
the
Force
when
he
chose
to
He
was
also
capable
of
using
telekinesis
to
push
or
levitate
objects
or
to
crush
them
as
seen
when
he
destroyed
two
commando
droids
to
recover
his
lightsaber
after
a
difficult
hand
to
hand
fight
with
Darts
D
Nar
He
would
also
use
the
Force
to
augment
his
natural
leaping
ability
His
ability
to
use
the
Force
push
technique
was
exceptional
as
he
was
able
to
use
it
to
blast
back
General
Grievous
dozens
of
meters
with
a
single
push
during
their
duel
A
short
time
later
he
was
even
able
to
hold
off
a
Force
blast
from
Anakin
Skywalker
during
their
duel
though
after
a
short
time
the
resulting
telekinetic
struggle
launched
both
of
them
across
a
room
Prior
to
his
exile
on
Tatooine
Yoda
instructed
him
on
how
to
communicate
his
late
master
Qui
Gon
Jinn
who
was
unable
to
visibly
manifest
as
a
spirit
due
to
his
incomplete
training
under
the
Force
Priestesses
Through
Jinn
Kenobi
eventually
learned
the
ability
to
manifest
his
consciousness
after
death
a
skill
he
would
later
put
to
good
use
to
guide
and
counsel
his
apprentice
Luke
Skywalker
during
the
Galactic
Civil
War
Other
abilitiesEdit
Obi
Wan
Kenobi
proved
himself
to
be
a
great
military
strategist
and
a
highly
studious
man
demonstrating
good
knowledge
on
galactic
history
or
conventions
of
war
like
the
Yavin
Code
He
personally
led
his
troops
to
many
famous
victories
during
the
Clone
Wars
and
his
persuasive
demeanor
earned
him
the
moniker
of
The
Negotiator
Despite
his
dislike
of
flying
Kenobi
was
an
excellent
pilot
During
the
Clone
Wars
he
led
many
attacks
from
the
cockpit
of
his
Jedi
starfighter
or
his
Jedi
interceptor
proving
to
be
an
outstanding
pilot
when
navigating
through
an
asteroid
field
in
pursuit
of
Jango
Fett
s
ship
and
evading
his
seismic
charges
unscathed
Kenobi
was
also
a
skilled
hand
to
hand
combatant
having
developed
enough
level
of
skill
in
unarmed
combat
so
as
to
compete
with
Pre
Vizsla
leader
of
the
Death
Watch
in
unarmed
techniques
though
he
outclassed
the
Mandalorian
in
lightsaber
technique
During
his
duel
with
Jango
Fett
on
Kamino
Kenobi
was
briefly
deprived
of
his
lightsaber
and
fought
the
bounty
hunter
in
unarmed
combat
Furthermore
while
he
preferred
lightsabers
Kenobi
was
an
excellent
marksman
as
demonstrated
during
his
time
as
Rako
Hardeen
in
Moralo
Eval
s
Box
Though
he
admitted
his
skills
were
rusty
Kenobi
could
read
hand
signals
accurately
enough
to
understand
Eeth
Koth
s
message
to
his
location
at
the
Saleucami
system
He

Alec
was
not

fond
of

however
and
thought
that

rubbish
He
disliked
very
much

Obi

However
The
Making
of

The

Behind

Original

stated
that
George

originally
came
up
with
the
idea
of
having
Ben
die
to
which
Guinness
initially
objected
By
explaining
that
Ben
would
have
little
to
do
in
the
story
after
the
Millennium
Falcon
escaped
the
Death

Lucas
convinced
him
to
allow
it
However
other
sources
indicate
that
the
idea
to
kill
off
Kenobi
came
from
Marcia
Lucas
after
her
husband
complained
he
was
unable
to
find
a
way
to
generate
tension
in
the

Obi

ghost
was
originally
present
in
the

drafts
of

Episode

The

but
director
Rian
Johnson
ultimately
decided
to
use
Yoda

instead
adding
that
the
only
version
of
Obi

who
interacted
with
Skywalker
was
the
one
of

Alec
Guinness
and
having
Luke
interacting
with

would
have

of

The

LINE

features
a
short
story
about
Luke
Skywalker
s
childhood
According
to
the
comic
despite
Lars
effort
to
prevent
Luke
from
meeting
Kenobi
Luke
eventually
met
him
when
he
became
years
old
Skywalker
went
on
an
adventure
with
his
friend
Windy
riding
a
dewback
but
they
soon
encountered
a
sandstorm
and
both
lost
consciousness
When
Skywalker
awoke
there
was
a
krayt
dragon
nearby
sneaking
up
on
him
Just
as
the
dragon
attempted
to
attack
Kenobi
appeared
and
beheaded
the
giant
creature
When
Skywalker
asked
who
he
was
Kenobi
answered
that
his
name
was
Ben
Kenobi
and
revealed
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
Skywalker
s
father
Kenobi
took
Skywalker
and
Windy
back
to
their
village
meeting
Skywalker
s
uncle
Owen
Lars
Lars
thanked
him
for
bringing
Luke
back
safely
but
told
him
to
stay
back
from
the
kid
because
he
didn
t
want
to
put
Skywalker
in
danger
In
return
Kenobi
said
he
was
observing
Skywalker
and
claimed
that
the
Force
was
strong
in
him
telling
Lars
that
he
would
leave
the
farm
one
day
Lars
responded
that
the
Jedi
were
done
since
the
Republic
had
fallen
warning
him
once
again
to
never
visit
their
homestead
again
Battles
and
wars
aren
t
the
measure
of
a
Jedi
Anyone
can
fight
given
a
weapon
and
an
enemy
Anyone
can
use
a
lightsaber
given
due
training
or
even
good
luck
But
to
stand
and
wait
to
have
so
much
patience
and
fortitude
that
Obi
Wan
is
a
greater
achievement
than
you

years

errand
declining

leave

uncomfortable
at

Before
Skywalker
could
give

at
Yoda
s

both
student
and
master
responded
to
a
mysterious
distress
signal
from
the
supposedly
dead
world
of
Carnelion
IV
that
specifically
called
for
Jedi
intercession
They
began
their
journey
to
the
coordinates
but
their
shuttle
was
damaged
due
to
the
planet
s
atmospheric
debris
field
and
the
two
had
to
eject
from
the
doomed
vessel
landing
below
the
Celadon
Sea
Not
too
long
afterwards
they
came
to
be
aware
of
there
being
life
on
the
planet
as
a
sky
battle
raged
over
them
and
Kenobi
returned
his
lightsaber
to
him
so
that
he
could
defend
himself
As
one
of
the
combatant
airships
began
to
fall
Skywalker
and
Kenobi
saved
its
two
person
crew
by
delaying
the
crash
The
survivors
Kolara
and
Mother
Pran
were
unaware
of

distress
signal
and
who
the
Jedi
were
Kenobi
was
then
able

use
a
mind
trick
on
Pran
to
lower
her
weapons

they
came
under

Kenobi
then
stopped

Grecker
from

destroyed

Kenobi
then
pulled

away
Kenobi
reasoned
with

that
they

As
they
made

they
came

Kenobi
then
refused
to
accept
to
give
them
the

also
told
Grecker
that
Skywalker
was
not
his

his
Padawan
at
the
dying
request
of
his

Grecker
then
defended

against
the
corpse

However
Pran
and
Kolara
took

with
them
and
abandoned
the
airship
Kenobi
was
then
left
behind
on
the
airship
as

destroyed

Kenobi

Grecker
were
then

Kenobi
was
then
able
to
use
the
force
to

Kenobi
then
asked
Grecker
to
tell
him
where

was
taken
to
Grecker
told
him
that
he
did
not

go

him
with
Grecker
after
getting
air
masks
on

Grecker
then
found
the
location
of

They
then
came

creature
Grecker

fired

Kenobi

Grecker
then
fought
until
a
masked
man
came
out
and
let
them
in
Kenobi
was
able
to
get
inside
before
Grecker
closed
the
door
The
man
Sera
then
showed
Kenobi
his

Kenobi
was
then
told
that
Sera
was
the
one
who
sent
the

He
then
told
Kenobi
about
his
collection
of
relics
and
how
both
the
open
and
closed
wanted
him
dead
Kenobi
then
learned
about
how
Sera
sent
the
signal
and
learned
about
both
the
Jedi
and
Sith
Kenobi
and
Sera
then
went
to
the
roof
to
watch
as
Grecker

attacked

Despite

told

spoke
with

Using

Kenobi
visited

he
was
unable

When

asked

she
surmised
that

exist
since
it
was
not
in

Unconvinced
Kenobi
visited
Master
Yoda
who
was
teaching

the

agreed
that
someone
had
erased
the
files
on

that
Kenobi
needed
to
visit
the
location
of

The

arranged
a

proclaiming
it

Skywalker

who
granted

came

Chuchi
met
with

to

in
response
to
intel
that
suggested
that
a
Separatist
bio
lab
had
been
set
up
on

Senator
Amidala
and
Representative
Binks
set
off
to
search
for
the
lab
but
contact
was
lost
and
Skywalker
sent
Tano
along
with
the
Gungan
native
Peppi
Bow
to
locate
them
Meanwhile
Skywalker
and
Kenobi
learned
from
new
information
discovered
by
Captain
Gregar
Typho
that
Separatist
scientist
Nuvo
Vindi
was
using
the
lab
to
perfect
the

so
as

As

Tano
Amidala

discovered
that
a
vial
of
the

was
missing
Though
they
were
able
to
sound
the
alarm
it
was
not
in

and
Vindi
s
servant
droid
was
able
to
detonate
a
bomb
releasing
the
virus
throughout
the
lab
The
Jedi
were
then
forced
to
make
their
way
to
the
planet
of

to
search
for
the
antidote
to
the
virus
so
as
to
save

While

the

were
able

free

there
from

prevent
the

from
leaving

spoke
to
the

man
she
realized

came
from

Kenobi
went
out
to
investigate
the
mines
and
discovered
that
the
Death
Watch
was
using
one
of
the
facilities
as
a
base
Taken
hostage
by
the
Death
Watch
he
contacted
Kryze
who
freed
him
and
together
they
tried
to
escape
when
they
were
attacked
and
the
Commander
of
the
Death
Watch
arrived
Revealing
himself
to
be
Viszla
he
returned
Kenobi
s
lightsaber
and
dueled
him
with
the
Darksaber
until
he
ordered
his
warrior
to
kill
him
with
missiles
Kenobi
and
Kryze
managed
to
escape
barely
surviving
and
returned
to
Mandalore
The
next
day
Kenobi
told
the
Duchess
that
he
believed
the
Separatists
were
involved
which
only
angered
her
the
Jedi
Master
then
was
joined
by
Skywalker
so
as
to
bodyguard
her
during
her
and
other
senators
trip
to
Coruscant
onboard
the
Coronet
On
their
way
to
the
Republic
s
capital
Kenobi
took
part
of
a
heated
debate
with
the
Duchess
over
what
the
best
course
of
action
was
to
deal
with
the
conflict
until
they
took
a
little
break
Then
Skywalker
asked
him
Kenobi
of
their
past
which
Kenobi
explained
he
and
his
master
Jinn
had
been
protecting
her
during
a
year
long
dangerous
mission
during
a
civil
war
on
Mandalore
It
was
then
that
assassin
droids
were
activated
prompting
Kenobi
to
defend
Kryze
When
the
droids
were
stopped
Skywalker
reported
to
Kenobi
that
one
of
the
senators
was
a
traitor
and
Kenobi
then
devised
a
plan
to
uncover
the
traitor
s
identity
by
using
the
last
active
droid
Obi
Wan
Satine
VoT
Kryze
safely
arriving
on
Coruscant
thanks
to
Kenobi
s
help
It
turned
out
to
be
Tal
Merrik
who
took
Kryze
as
a
hostage
and
made
his
way
to
the
cockpit
to
jump
out
of
hyperspace
so
that
droid
reinforcements
could
enter
the
ship
While
Skywalker
engaged
the
droids
Kenobi
found
and
followed
Merrik
who
would
blow
up
the
ship
as
he
got
near
the
escape
pods
unable
to
make
a
move
on
the
senator
Afraid
she
might
not
see
Kenobi
again
Kryze
confessed
her
feelings
for
him
to
which
Kenobi
replied
he
would
have
left
the
Order
if
she
had
told
him
earlier
Then
Kryze
took
the
opportunity
to
escape
a
disgusted
Merrik
and
take
his
blaster
However
neither
Kenobi
nor
Kryze
made
a
move
to
stop
him
leaving
Skywalker
to
sneak
up
from
behind
and
stab
him
in
the
back
branding
himself
as
a
cold
blooded
killer
After
arriving
on
Coruscant
Kenobi
and
Kryze
reflected
upon
the
situation
and
the
Duchess
flirted
with
him
saying
his
beard
hid
too
much
of
his
handsome
face
When
Kryze
s
pleas
to
the
Senate
to
not
interfere
with
Mandalore
s
internal
affairs
went
unheard
Kenobi
reunited
with
the
Duchess
advising
her
not
to
be
rash
angering
her
Soon
enough
she
was
victim
to
another
terrorist
attack
and
barely
survived
prompting
the
Senate
to
accelerate
the
vote
with
the
Republic
deciding
to
occupate
Mandalore
Despite
Kenobi
s
plea
to
help
her
Kryze
took
matters
in
her
own
hands
only
to
framed
with
murder
by
the

Asking

the

she
had
obtained
from
his
contact
Despite
an
attack
by
a
Death

assassin
and
Kryze
turning
herself
in
Kenobi
got
the
disc
through
to
Amidala
who
then
played

complete

from

about

Kenobi
and

managed
to
engage
Maul
and

just
as
they
began
their
attack
on

As
the
fight
progressed
Gallia
was
slain
by
Opress
and
after
taking
up
his
fallen
comrade
s
lightsaber
to
help
defend
himself
Kenobi
was
forced
to
retreat
and
reunite
with
Onhaka
Inside
a
cave
Ohnaka
decided
to
ambush
the
men
while
Kenobi
decided
to
confront
Maul
and
Opress
With
great
skill
and
Gallia
s
lightsaber
Kenobi
violently
fought
the
pair
changing
to
Ataru
and
demonstrating
mastery
of
his
former
fighting
style
Eventually
he
injures
Opress
knee
and
cuts
his
left
arm
off
However
before
Kenobi
could
continue
the
fight
Maul
Force
pushed
him
into
another
part
of
the
cave
bringing
the
fight
to
an
end
Realizing
their
plan
had
failed
the
Dathomirans
left
and
headed
off
planet
to
try
again
another
time
Their
ship
however
was
shot
down
and
the
two
were
forced
to
head
for
an
escape

As
the
ship
fell
Kenobi
went
with
Hondo
to
see
what
riches
had
fallen
from
the
sky
but
there
were
no
signs
of
Maul
nor
Opress
leaving
Kenobi
to
doubt
their
demise
Following
the
confrontation
Kenobi
returned
to
Coruscant
where
he
explained
to
Chancellor
Palpatine
about
the
situation
regarding
Darth
Maul
but
Palpatine
dismissed
the
Maul
s
threat
saying
that
the
Jedi
needed
to
focus
on
the
Separatist
threat
despite
Kenobi
s
fears
of
the
criminal
underworld
being
a
place
where
Maul
could
flourish
Following
Maul
s
takeover
of
Mandalore
Kenobi
was
summoned
to
meet
with
Yoda
and
Ki
Adi
Mundi
in
the
communications
room
The
two
showed
him
a
transmission
that
had
been
sent
by
Satine
Kryze
from
Mandalore
In
the
message
she
stated
that
her
government
had
been
overthrown
by
rogue
criminals
only
for
the
transmission
to
be
abruptly
cut
Despite
Yoda
and
Mundi
s
reluctance
to
take
part
in
the
internal
affairs
of

Kenobi
borrowed
the
Twilight
from

headed

all
the
way
to
the
faulty

Realizing
that
he
has
arrived
Maul
personally
hunted
down
Kenobi
and
managed
to
ensure
that
the
Twilight
was
shot
down
before
it
could
leave
After
the
Jedi
jumped
from
the
doomed
ship
Maul
captured
the
now
dizzy
Kenobi
as
Opress
lifted
an
unconscious
Kryze
and
ordered
them
taken
back
to
the
royal
palace
Maul
realizing
Kenobi
s
feelings
for
Satine
decided
to
execute
her
with

that
he
would

the

go

stabbed
her
with

ultimately
died
in

with

that

always
loved

made
aware

attack
on
Saleucami
To
alert
his
fellow

in
the
Jedi

held
a
conference
where
he
was
suggested
for
their
fleets
to
move
to
the
Anoat
system
and
move
across
to
Saleucami
when
he
was
interrupted
by
Admiral
Tarkin
who
told
the
Council
that
Tano
was
requested
by
Letta
Turmond
Following
Tano
s
escape
from
authorities
to
prove
her
innocence
Kenobi
along
with
the
rest
of
the
Jedi
High
Council
and
Skywalker
held
a
emergency
meeting
with
Tarkin
declaring
to
them
that
Tano
was
now
accused
of
sedition
With
Skywalker
and
Plo
Koon
doubtful
of
her
guilt
Grand
Master
Yoda
sent
the
two
to
find
her
but
Windu
attempted
to
have
Skywalker
left
out
of
the
matter
believing
having
him
involved
would
only
making
things
worse
due
to
his
emotional
bond
with
Tano
However
Kenobi
convinced
the
Council
otherwise
stating
Skywalker
knew
Tano
best
and
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
take
him
off
the
mission
After
her
capture
Kenobi
listened
to
Tarkin
as
he
informed
the
Council
that
the
Senate
requested
for
Tano
to
be
expelled
from
the
Jedi
Order
and
turned
over
to
the
Republic
military
so
she
could
receive
more
impartial
judgement
Kenobi
tried
to
convince
his
fellow
Council
members
that
they
should
side
with
Tano
but
they
all
refused
to
do
so
as
they
feared
that
protecting
Tano
would
damage
their
ties
with
the
Senate
Despite
his
reluctance
to
hand
Tano
over
to
the
Republic
Kenobi
took
part
of
Tano
s
trial
in
the
Chamber
of
Judgment
where
the
Council
stripped
the
young
Togruta
of
her
rank
and
status
as
a
Jedi
Like
other
members
of
the
Council
Kenobi
was
present
during
Tano
s
military
trial
as
presided
over
by
Chancellor
Palpatine
and
during
Barriss
Offee
s
confession
which
confirmed
Tano
s
innocence
Along
with
the
Council
Kenobi
agreed
that
Tano
should
rejoin
the

and
was
present
when
Windu
and
Yoda
proclaimed
her
to
be
a
true
Jedi
worthy
of
becoming

for
her
to
refuse

they
spoke

and
told
them
that
they
had
been
paid
by
a
man
called

shoot

down
However
as

paid
for

dangerous
they
kept

During

absent
mindedness

turmoil

asked
him
to
keep
an

Soon
however
Yoda
revealed
to
the
Council
in
full
that
a
voice
spoke
to
him
from
beyond
prompting
Kenobi
and
the
entire
Council
to
perform
a
joint
meditation
with
him

they
heard
nothing

Master

surmised
it
could
be
a
deception
by
the
Sith

Kenobi
dismissed
the
idea
believing
Yoda
could
not
be
susceptible
to
such
manipulation

Windu
replied
that
even
as
wise
and
old
as
he
was
Yoda
was
not
beyond
the
corruption
of
the
dark
side

himself
for

were
told
by
Rig
Nema
that
Yoda
was
in
perfect
mental
health
even
if
he
approached

hundredth
year
of
life
Though
Mundi
suggested
the
Dark
Lord
of
the

could
be
using
Yoda
s
connection
to
Dooku
Kenobi
vehemently
rejected
the
idea
saying
they
all
had
been
apprenticed
to
Yoda
at
one
point

another
Before
the
discussion
could
go
on

go

dropping

low

stopped
the
test
When
asked
about

Kenobi
told
him
Yoda
was
sure
he
had

like
most
he

speaking
to

Though
the
Governor
asked
them
to
leave

Kenobi
and
Skywalker
persevered
and
rented
two
dactillions
to
go
to
the
city
s
lower
levels
and
talk
to
the
leader
of
an
Amani
tribe
there
Told
that
an
Amani
outcast
had
been
seen
entering
a
cave
not
far
from
there
Kenobi
thanked
him
and
he
and
Skywalker
went
to
the
cave
where
they
found
the
MagnaGuards
leading
them
to
suspect
of
a
Separatist
conspiracy
Despite
some
resistance
they
managed
to
get
information
from
the
droids
that
showed
them
the
involvement
of
the
Sugi
and
went
to
see
Inspector
June
once
again
After
she
identified
the
Amani
as
coming
from
the
plain
Kenobi
contacted
the
Council
to
inform
them
of
their
findings
and
later
attended
together
with
Skywalker
attended
the
funeral
of
Tu
Anh
Soon
after
they
reached
the
Amani
settlement
they
had
been
looking
for
only
for
their
dactillions
to
be
killed
and
for
the
Amani
to
scatter
in
every
direction
during
the
ensuing
confrontation
leaving
Skywalker
and
Kenobi
to
follow
the
tracks
of
one
that
appeared
to
be
their
leader
During
the
hunt
Skywalker
mentioned
Tano
for
the
first
time
since
her
departure
and
Kenobi
asked
if
he
wanted
to
talk
about
it
yet
Skywalker
refused
Kenobi
then
suggested
for
them
to
set
up
a
camp
and
rest
However
he
insisted
on
the
subject
prompting
Skywalker
to
tell
Kenobi
he
missed
Tano
and
to
voice
his
anger
at
the
High
Council
for
turning
its
back
on
her
In
response
Kenobi
asserted
that
it
had
been
Tano
s
decision
to
leave
and
that
she
had
allowed
her
emotions
to
cloud
her
judgement
something
against
the
Jedi
way
Then
Kenobi
suggested
him
to
rest
but
Skywalker
declined
so
that
he
could
keep
the
first
watch
Finally
he
questioned
Kenobi
on
what
would
happen
if
he
had
turned
out
to
be
a
major
disappointment
but
Kenobi
wanted
to
believe
it
would
never
happen

However
they
both
fell
asleep
and
were
captured
by
a
group
of
Sugis
led
by
Chong
who
brought
them
before
Endente
as
Kenobi
told
Chong
of
their
intention
to
buy
weapons
However
they
learned
Endente
was
in
fact
selling
a
kyber
crystal
and
Skywalker
prompted
him
to
show
it
before
they
made
the
deal
The
two
Jedi
were
then
brought
to
the
starship
where
the
crystal
was
being
kept
and
escaped
from
their
captors
Once
Skywalker
took
out
all
the
Sugi
and
recovered
their
lightsabers
from
Chong
they
were
unable
to
capture
Endente
and
discovered
the

kyber
crystal
inside

ship
Despite
being
attacked
the
two
Jedi
managed
to
transport
the
crystal
through
Utapau

plains
until
they
reached
Pau
City
where
Governor
Blom
showed
them
his
true
colors
and
had
the
two
Jedi
surrounded
with
his
men
and

droids
As
the
kyber
crystal
was
loaded
into
a
shuttle
and
sent
to

on
orbit
Kenobi
and
Skywalker
took
June
and

as
hostages

underlings
stopped
shooting
at
them

and

soon
damaged

forcing
them
to
crash
the
ship
to
damage
the
hyperdrive
and
board
the
ship
where
the
crystal
was
then
held
However
they
got
separated
and
Kenobi
landed
in
a
hangar
full
of
droids
where
he
was
soon
confronted
and
captured
by
Grievous
Following
Dooku
s
orders
to
execute
him
Kenobi
was
being
escorted
to

rescued
him
Together
their
made
their
way
to
the
kyber

vault
where
they
were
temporarily
trapped
until
a
squad
discovered

Using
the
crystal
and
the
Force
to
knock
them
out
he
managed
to
get
to
a
hangar
where
Skywalker
got
a
shuttle
for
them
to
escape
Meanwhile
Kenobi
set
several
AATs
to
shoot
and
overload
the

Kenobi

it

to
bring
about
the

he
nevertheless

Kenobi

Vos
would
be
deployed
to
a
listening
post
on
Vanqor
but
their
second
fruitless
campaign
in
a
row
made
Kenobi
suspicious
of
a
leak
He
confided
his
feelings
to
Yoda

Windu
leading
them
to
suspect
Vos
was
the
leak
Kenobi
would
later
be
summoned
by
Yoda
to
tell
him
that
he
had

darkness
in

that
Palpatine

Before
parting
though
Skywalker
apologized
to
Kenobi
who
told
him
that
he
needed
patience
and
that
he
would
soon
become
a

Then
the

Master
departed
for

where
he
managed
to
sneak
up
on
the
Separatists
with
help
of
a
varactyl

and
confront

personally
The

Desperate

to
find
that
Skywalker
had
led
his
battalion
of
clones
to
attack
the

where
he
fought

and
kneeled
to
the
newly

was
proud
of

now
going

Though

was
horrified

determined
that
they
had
to
destroy

Kenobi
however
refused
to
fight
Vader
and
requested
that
he
be
sent
to
kill
the
Emperor
instead
but
Yoda
vetoed
the
idea
Kenobi
expressed
that
Skywalker
was
like
a
brother
to
him
and
that
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
kill
him
yet
Yoda
explained
that
the
boy
he
had
trained
no
longer
existed
and
that
he
needed

also

emerged
from

for

to
think

As

Vader
accused
him
of
trying

against

but
the
Jedi
Master
stated
that
his

and
that

Realizing
that
he
spoke
like

Kenobi
vowed
to
stop
him
at
all
costs
prompting
the
two
to
engage
in
a
brutal
duel
that
caused
substantial
damage
to

Kenobi
jumped

gaining
advantage
over

Despite
Kenobi

warning
not

in

surrounded
by
Western

Sea
Within
the
first
year
of
the
Age
of
the
Empire
Kenobi
visited
the
grave
of
Shmi
Skywalker
Lars
mother
of
Anakin
and
spoke
of
how
he
was
sad
for
what
had
happened
to
her
once
innocent
and
promising
young
son
To
conceal
his
identity
he
would
once
again
use
the
alias
of
Ben
Kenobi
as
he
had
done
during
the
Clone
Wars
and
forfeited
the
use
of
his

for
years
however
he
struggled
to
repress
his
sense
of
duty
as
a
Jedi
he
spent
years
battling
monotony
and
inactivity
and
gained
the
reputation
of
being
somewhat
of
an
old
hermit
At
some
point
Kenobi
would
be
forbidden
from
seeing
or
training
Luke
as
Lars
feared
the

would
end
up

in
a
box
labeled
For

In
one
of

Kenobi
wrote
about
how
he
stopped
Jabba
the
Hutt
s
men
from
collecting
their
water
tax
on
the
local
farmers
during
the
Great
Drought
eight
years
into

He
kept
Jabba
s
thugs
from
extorting
the
Lars
family
into
paying
their
water
tax
following
his
subtle
use
of
the
Force
to
cause
the
thugs
firearms
to
misfire
so
that
wouldn
t
harm
townspeople
he
decided
not
to
go
into
town
anymore
That
same
night
he
sensed
Skywalker
to
be
in
danger
for
the
boy
had
gone
to
take
the
water
back
from
Jabba
s
men
and
give
it
back
to
the
farmers
Kenobi
went
to
their
encounter
but
blew
their
vehicle
s
lights
with
the
Force
to
hide
his
identity
and
proceeded
to
disable
all
of
Jabba
s
henchmen
with
the
Force
One
of
them
became
startled
and
pushed
Skywalker
to
the
ground
causing
him
to
hit
his
head
and
pass
out
Once
Kenobi
handled
all
the
thugs
he
carried
Skywalker
to
the
Lars
homestead
and
left
before
he
woke
up
Luke
s
courage
assured
Kenobi
that
it
wasn
t
the
end
of
the
Jedi
and
renewed
his
up
until
then
waning
hope
A
year
later
the
Great
Drought
had
ended
and
Kenobi
found
himself
observing
a
young
Luke
piloting
a
T
skyhopper
through
Beggar
s
Canyon
Kenobi
noted
how
similar
Luke
was
to
his
father
Anakin
and
expressed
worry
at
the
prospect
While
attempting
to
impress
his
friends
with
an
ostentatious
maneuver
through
the
canyon
Luke
badly
damaged
the
Skyhopper
and
was
subsequently
grounded
from
flying
by
his
uncle
Kenobi
feeling
sympathy
for
the
boy
took
a
job
protecting
a
Jawa
sandcrawler
that
had
been
experiencing
troublesome
raids
by
Tusken
Raiders
That
night
Kenobi
meditated
outside
of
the
sandcrawler
communing
with
Qui
Gon
and
expressing
his
hope
in
Luke
s
abilities
Soon
the
Tusken
Raiders
arrived
and
Kenobi
able
to
easily
dispatch
the
party
with
a
disarmed
raider
s
Gaderffii
stick
He
used
whatever
payment
he
earned
from
the
job
to
hire
the
Jawa
s
to
deliver
the
necessary
parts
to
fix
the
Skyhopper
At
a
droid
auction
at
an
unidentified
outpost
Luke
received
the
the
parts
Kenobi
had
provided
for
him
Luke
believed
the
parts
had
been
a
gift
from
his
uncle
and
thanked
Owen
as
he
eagerly
rushed
back
home
Deriving
pleasure
from
the
boys
enthusiasm
Kenobi
grinned
fondly
as
he
observed
from
behind
a
nearby
tent
Later
that
day
in
his
hut
Kenobi
was
cooking
dinner
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
Owen
Owen
had
put
two
and
two
together
and
sternly
demanded
that
Kenobi
have
no
part
in
his
family
s
life
He
had
brought
back
the
box
of
tools
that
he
presumably
confiscated
from
Luke
and
dumped
it
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
Kenobi
responded
back
with
several
snarky
replies
before
finally
relenting
and
saying
he
that
he
only
ever
wanted
to
help
Owen
continued
to
berate
him
calling
him
dangerous
and
troublesome
As
Owen
departed
Kenobi
regretfully
admitted
to
himself
that
danger
did
in
fact
seemed
to
follow
him
But
he
steeled
his
resolve
and
claimed
that
no
danger
would
come
to
the
young
Skywalker
boy
as
long
as
he
lived
Coincidentally
Jabba
the
Hutt
chose
this
time
to
send
a
Wookiee
bounty
hunter
Black
Krrsantan
after
Owen
who
he
believed
was
responsible
for
roughing
up
his
tax
collectors
during
the
Great
Drought
The
next
day
Owen
had
a
change
of
heart
and
himself
purchased
a
box
of
parts
He
searched
through
the
Lars
homestead
looking
for
Luke
hoping
to
fix
the
Skyhopper
with
the
boy
as
a
way
to
apologize
for
his
coarse
actions
the
previous
day
However
he
was
ambushed
by
Black
Krrsantan
and
kidnapped
Luke
in
childish
defiance
was
running
away
from
home
He
made
it
a
short
distance
out
before
sensing
likely
through
the
Force
that
something
had
gone
awry
at
the
homestead
Back
home
he
encountered
a
wounded
Beru
who
informed
him
about
what
had
transpired
and
warned
him
to
stay
home
She
ran
out
of
the
house
armed
with
a
rifle
leaving
Luke
with
the
discarded
pile
of
tools
Owen
had
earlier
dropped
While
meditating
in
the
Dune
Sea
among
a
herd
of
Banthas
Kenobi
felt
a
disturbance
in
the
Force
He
traversed
the
side
of
a
rocky
mountain
before
finding
Krrsantan
beating
Owen
In
the
ensuing
conflict
Kenobi
was
trapped
under
a
mesh
of
stun
net
that
was
dispatched
by
the
Wookiee
Krrsantan
then
knocked
Owen
off
the
mountain
who
quickly
grabbed
hold
onto
a
protrusion
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
Kenobi
escaped
the
net
and
stunned
the
Wookiee
sprinting
over
to
Owen
to
grab
him
back
up
However
Krrsantan
intervened
and
threw
an
enormous
bolder
at
Kenobi
Kenobi
used
his
lightsaber
to
split
the
rock
in
two
also
blinding
Krrsantan
in
one
eye
during
the
process
The
debris
from
the
rock
crashed
into
Owen
s
ledge
and
he
nearly
fell
if
not
for
Kenobi
s
use
of
the
Force
Kenobi
held
Owen
in
place
using
the
Force
before
losing
focus
as
a
result
of
Krrsantan
s
constant
attacks
Owen
fell
but
was
deftly
saved
by
Luke
who
used
the
repaired
Skyhopper
s
turret
to
break
Owen
s
fall
Kenobi
then
used
this
opportunity
to
disarm
the
Wookiee
who
plunged
off
the
side
of
the
mountain
He
did
not
die
however
and
escaped
off
world
to
escape
Jabba
s
wrath
Owen
reunited
with
Luke
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
held
the
boy
in
deep
embrace
He
casted
a
knowing
glance
up
toward
Kenobi
who
looked
on
in
triumph
There
were
no
words
of

between

Kenobi
then
returned
to
his
family
which
was
what
he
fondly
called
his
herd
of
Banthas
Among
them
he
looked
up
into
the

to
see
Luke

soaring
off
into

Twin

Kenobi
prepares
to
face
Maul
one
last
time
In
BBY
Maul
arrived
on
Tatooine
in
search
of
Kenobi
following
his
vision
of
the
twin
suns
Unable
to
successfully
trace
him
Maul
used
a
Sith
holocron
to
lure
Ezra
Bridger
there
hoping
the
young
Jedi
s
pain
would
be
enough
to
draw
Kenobi
out
Kenobi
found
Ezra
unconscious
in
the
Dune
Sea
and
sheltered
him
from
the
storm
When
Ezra
regained
consciousness
he
alerted
Obi
Wan
of
Maul
s
presence
Kenobi
calmly
replied
that
he
knew
of
it
all
and
that
he
didn
t
go
into
hiding
unprepared
He
told
Ezra
that
it
was
Ezra
s
responsibility
to
help
the
Rebellion
not
to
handle
Maul
That
burden
fell
upon
Kenobi
himself
Soon
thereafter
Maul
arrived
seething
with
rage
upon
seeing
his
old
rival
after
so
many
years
Kenobi
sent
Bridger
off
on
a
dewback
toward
Maul
s
ship
which
Bridger
would
use
to
fly
off
world
back
to
Atollon
Maul
mocked
Kenobi
s
lackluster
living
conditions
and
wondered
out
loud
whether
it
would
be
more
cruel
to
simply
leave
Kenobi
to
what
Maul
believed
was
a
life
of
misery
and
squalor
But
rather
than
responding
with
mockery
in
turn
as
he
might
have
in
his
younger
years
Kenobi
calmly
and
succinctly
explained
to
Maul
that
the
former
Sith
Lord
in
fact
had
even
less
because
he
defined
himself
by
his
empty
desires
to
kill
possess
and
dominate
This
infuriated
Maul
who
ignited
one
of
the
blades
of
his
saberstaff
and
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
Kenobi
s
small
campfire
showering
it
with
sand
and
putting
it
out
Maul
then
began
to
speculate
on
his
old
nemesis
s
reasons
for
being
on
Tatooine
and
quickly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
Kenobi
was
there
to
protect
someone
Stirred
to
action
by
the
threat
of
Maul
to
Luke
Kenobi
ignited
his
lightsaber
and
assumed
his
traditional
Form
III
stance
As
Maul
tightened
his
grip
on
his
own
saber
and
ignited
his
second
blade
Kenobi
shifted
his
stance
to
the
one
used
by
his
old
master
Qui
Gon
during
the
duel
on
Naboo
in
the
Theed
power
generator
Maul
dies
but
for
real
this
time
Maul
dies
in
Kenobi
s
arms
Maul
noted
Kenobi
s
change
in
stance
and
after
a
few
tense
moments
attacked
He
crossed
blades
with
Kenobi
twice
before
attempting
to
hit
him
with
the
same
hilt
strike
that
had
allowed
him
to
kill
Qui
Gon
However
Kenobi
had
evidently
anticipated
this
and
he
struck
down
at
Maul
s
hilt
as
Maul
struck
upwards
bisecting
Maul
s
lightsaber
and
carving
a
lethal
laceration
into
the
former
Sith
Lord
s
chest
Maul
dropped
his
ruined
weapon
and
collapsed
to
one
knee
but
Kenobi
caught
him
before
he
could
fall
to
the
ground
and
held
him
As
Maul
laid
dying
he
asked
Kenobi
whether
the
person
whom
he
was
protecting
was
the
Chosen
One
the
one
prophesied
to
destroy
the
Sith
Kenobi
at
that
point
of
the
opinion
believed
that
Vader
would
never
turn
from
the
dark
side
replied
that
he
was
Maul
appeared
to
take
some
modicum
of
comfort
from
this
knowledge
seemingly
certain
that
he
and
Kenobi
would
ultimately
be
avenged
Kenobi
then
paid
his
last
rites
to
Maul
and
traveled
via
dewback
to
the
Lars
Homestead
Upon
arriving
there
he
heard
Beru
Whitesun
Lars
calling
to
Luke
and
saw
the
teenager
running
back
home
against
a

told

brought
about

also
explained

showed
him
Organa

asking
him
to

then
asked

to
join
him
on
his
trip
to
the
planet
to
learn
the
ways
of
the
Force
but
the
young
man
refused
saying
that
he
was
needed
back
on
the
farm
and
offered
to
take
him
to
Anchorhead
On
their
way
to
the
city
the
two
then
discovered
that
stormtroopers
were
in
the
desert
looking
for
the
two
droids
and
Skywalker
headed
back
home
despite
Kenobi
s
warning
not
to
Kenobi
then
waited
for
Skywalker
to
come
back
and
arranged
a
small
funeral
pyre
for
all
the
Jawas
killed
by
the
Empire
s
soldiers
It
was
at
this
time
that
he
was
met
by
the
spectre
of
Jinn
who
offered
him
counsel
When
Skywalker
returned
the
young
man
agreed
to
go
with
him
to
Alderaan
and
be
trained
as
a
Jedi
Afterwards
the
four
went
to
Mos
Eisley
where
they
entered
a
cantina
to
search
for
a
pilot
There
they
found
the
Corellian
smuggler
Han

Kenobi
s
communion
with
Qui
Gon
was
successful
as
Kenobi
did
not
vanish
completely
but
became
a
Force
spirit
As
he
did
he
felt
past

seeing
the
eventual
death
of

on
Starkiller

and
his

able
to
guide

during
the
Battle

so
that
he
could
successfully
destroy
the
Death
Star
with
proton
torpedoes
About
five
days
later
the
spirit
of
Kenobi
would
go
to
Dagobah
where
he
would
visit
Yoda
regarding
Skywalker
Kenobi
listened
as
Yoda
explained
that
Leia
was
by
far
the
best
candidate
to
pick
up
the
mantle
of
Jedi
as
Luke
was
impetuous
headstrong
unruly
and
inattentive
like
Anakin
Nevertheless
Kenobi
remained
steadfast
in
his
resolve
that
Luke
be
trained
and
was
successful
in
gaining
Yoda
s
approval
to
bring
the
boy
to
him
When
Skywalker
was
about
to
confront
Darth
Vader
in
the
weapons
factory
Alpha
on
the
assault
of
Cymoon
Kenobi
reached
out
to
Skywalker
through
the
Force
and
told
him
to
run
Later
while
Luke
was
stationed
above
Vrogas
Vas
he
was
attacked
by
Vader
and
crash
landed
near
an
abandoned
Jedi
Temple
he
had
read
about
in
one
of
Kenobi
s
journals
however
while
searching
for
something
to
use
in
the
temple
he
was
contacted
by
Kenobi
s
voice
which
told
him
to
abandon
the
place
as
he
did
not
believe
Luke
was
ready
As
Luke
asked
how
he
should
get
ready
he
was
attacked
and
captured
by
General
Karbin
s
stormtroopers
When
Vader
entered
the
temple
Kenobi
called
out
to
him
stating
that
Luke
was
the
Chosen
One
and
once
again
expressed
his
regret
for
Vader
s
fall
Vader
dismissed
Kenobi
s
presence
as
a
delusion
Three
years
later
Kenobi
would
reappear
to
Luke
on
the
ice
planet
of
Hoth
where
he
instructed
Skywalker
to
go
to
the
Dagobah
system
to
seek
out
Kenobi
s
former
master
Yoda
for
further
Jedi
training
Yoda
once
again
expressed
doubts
concerning
Skywalker
still
believing
him
to
be
too
old
impatient
and
reckless
as
much
as
he
had
anger
in
him
like
his
father
once
had
However
Kenobi
reminded
Yoda
that
he
had
been
once
similar
to
Luke
back
when
Yoda
taught
him
When
Skywalker
received
a
vision
of
his
friends
in
trouble
on
the
Cloud
City
of
Bespin
Skywalker
rushed
to
aid
them
Kenobi
warned
him
that
he
was
at
a
crossroads
and
that
his
abilities
were
what
the
Emperor
wanted
Kenobi
didn
t
want
to
lose
Skywalker
to
the
Emperor
the
way
he
had
lost
Vader
He
also
told
the
Jedi
apprentice
that
if
he
was
to
face
Darth
Vader
he
would
do
it
alone
as
he
couldn
t
interfere
Finally
Kenobi
gave
Skywalker
some
final
advice
in
that
he
shouldn
t
give
into
hate
for
it
led
to
the
dark
side
As
Skywalker
departed
from
Dagobah
Kenobi
was
worried
that
the
Jedi
may
have

last
hope
only
for
Yoda
to
remind
him

Luke
Chatting

to
Luke
about

About
a
year
later
he
reappeared
after
the
death
of
Yoda
to
explain
why
he
did
not
tell
Luke
the
truth
about
his
father
Though
Luke
wanted
to
believe
that
there
was
still
good
in
his
father
echoing
Padm
s
belief
from
twenty
three
years
ago
Kenobi
no
longer
held
that
belief
He
told
Luke
that
he
must
face
his
destiny
by
confronting
Vader
once
again
When
Luke
asked
the
meaning
of
Yoda
s
final
words
there
is
another

confessed
that

that

youth

humor

sarcastic
wit

Jinn

Padawan
a

wiser
than
him
if
somewhat
headstrong
Often
seen
wise
beyond

his
humble
and
soft

demeanor
belied
his

prowess
Despite
his
numerous
complaints

was
also

garnering
him
the
aforementioned
nom
de

Kenobi
was
also
known
to
be
an
accomplished
storyteller
While
hiding
in
the
Jundland
Wastes
in
his
later
years
he
appeared
as
a
kindly
and
eccentric
old
hermit
or
in
Owen
Lars
words
That
wizard
is
just
a
crazy
old
man
to
those
not
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
Jedi
In
his
final
days
Kenobi
retained
his
traits
of
patience
and
foresight
as
well
as
gaining
some
of
the
boldness
reminiscent
of
his
youth
Kenobi
often
thought
out
plans
and
strategies
rather
than
leaping
into
action
He
would
usually
place
his
hand
on
his
chin
or
stroke
his
beard
as
he
thought
This
was
a
common
trait
of
the
Jedi
Master
one
that
his
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
did
not
practice
very
often
He
sometimes
mentally
repeated
the
Jedi
Code
to
calm
himself
Kenobi
s
respect
for
the
lives
of
others
led
him
to
emerge
from
hiding
to
save
Ezra
Bridger
and
the
C
series
astromech
droid
Chopper
from
succumbing
to
the
deserts
of
Tatooine
Kenobi
then
reproved
Ezra
for
succumbing
to
Maul
s
manipulation
and
counselled
the
young
rebel
to
return
to
his
place
with
the
rebellion
Despite
not
hating
Maul
Kenobi
was
prepared
to
fight
and
kill
him
in
self
defense
After
mortally
wounding
Maul
Kenobi
comforted
the
former
Sith
and
assured
him
that
he
was
watching
over
the
Chosen
One
Luke
Skywalker
though
Luke
was
not
the
Chosen
One
by

MR
Obi
wan
Kenobi
s
third
and
last
lightsaber
Kenobi
was
a
very
capable
lightsaber
duelist
one
of
the
greatest
swordsmen
of
his
time
Throughout
his
training
years
he
had
learnt
several
forms
of
lightsaber
combat
especially
Form
III
In
contrast
to
the
aggressive
dueling
styles
of
his
master
Qui
Gon
Jinn
and
his
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
Kenobi
s
combat
style
was
mainly
defensive
though
he
would
use
aggressive
attacks
when
pressed
He
faced
some
of
the
most
dangerous
people
in
the
galaxy
such
as
the
deadly
Sith
Lord
Darth
Maul
and
infamous
Jedi
Hunter
General
Grievous
respectively
the
latter
of
whom
he
fought
on
at
least
seven
occasions
Though
he
lost
to
the
cyborg
in
three
of
their
encounters
the
first
fifth
and
sixth
he
was
able
to
survive
every
time
without
any
serious
injury
He
was
able
to
duel
Grievous
to
a
draw
in
their
third
and
fourth
encounters
and
was
able
to
overpower
him
in
their
second
duel
and
ultimately
killed
him
in
the
final
round
However
it
should
be
noted
that
Kenobi
ultimately
killed
Grievous
with
a
blaster
rather
than
his
lightsaber
Although
Kenobi
usually
used
only
one
lightsaber
he
also
seemed
to
have
been
well
versed
in
the
art
of
Jar
Kai
which
was
perhaps
most
prominently
displayed
during
his
duel
with
Darth
Maul
and
Savage
Opress
in
which
he
wielded
both
his
own
lightsaber
and
the
lightsaber
of
the
deceased
Adi
Gallia
His
mastery
of
dual
blade
combat
allowed
him
to
hold
his
own
against
both
the
Sith
brothers
and
he
even
managed
to
break
Opress
s
left
knee
and
sever
his
left
arm
The
duel
ultimately
ended
as
a
stalemate
when
Maul
used
his
Force
powers
to
briefly
incapacitate
Kenobi
giving
the
brothers
time
to
escape
Kenobi
also
situationally
and
somewhat
less
successfully
used
Jar
Kai
against
General
Grievous
and
Cad
Bane
respectively
He
was
also
capable
of
using
his
lightsaber
to
ground
Force
lightning
as
he
demonstrated
against
Dooku
on
Geonosis
Kenobi
was
also
able
to
defeat
his
former
apprentice
Anakin
Skywalker
then
Darth
Vader
in
an
epic
duel
on
Mustafar
Making
use
of
his
staunch
Form
III
defense
throughout
the
fight
Obi
Wan
was
eventually
able
to
exploit
Vader
s
aggressive
nature
and
dismembered
the
hate
filled
Sith
Lord
when
he
recklessly
jumped
towards
him
Decades
later
he
defeated
his
old
nemesis
Maul
within
seconds
despite
the
former
Sith
Lord
having
demonstrated
the
ability
to
hold
an
advantage
against
three
Inquisitors
simultaneously
and
duel
his
master
Darth
Sidious
for
a
short
time
A
short
time
later
during
his
rematch
with
Vader
on
the
first
Death
Star
he
proved
formidable
enough
to
hold
his
own
against
the
Dark
Lord
for
a
short
time
However
Vader
s
cautious
but
relentless
assault
ultimately
overwhelmed
Kenobi
s
defenses
and
he
was
forced
to
begin
retreating
Ultimately
he
chose
to
become
one
with
the
Force
rather
than
continue
the
fight
and
in
doing
this
he
taught
both
of
his
Skywalker
students
one
final
lesson
Force
powersEdit
The
Force
is
what
gives
a
Jedi
his
power
It
s
an
energy
field
created
by
all
living
things
It
surrounds
us
and
penetrates
us
It
binds
the
galaxy
together

Though
Kenobi
focused
largely
on
lightsaber
combat
he
was
also
very
skilled
and
powerful
in
use
of
the
Force
He
was
trained
in
the
use
of
the
mind
trick
making
use
of
it
whenever
he
wanted
to
avoid
physical
confrontations
He
was
also
able
to
use
the
Force
to
tame
control
and
lead
a
group
of
angry
gutkurrs
on
Ryloth
As
befitted
a
Jedi
Kenobi
was
adept
at
concealing
his
feelings
in
the
Force
when
he
chose
to
He
was
also
capable
of
using
telekinesis
to
push
or
levitate
objects
or
to
crush
them
as
seen
when
he
destroyed
two
commando
droids
to
recover
his
lightsaber
after
a
difficult
hand
to
hand
fight
with
Darts
D
Nar
He
would
also
use
the
Force
to
augment
his
natural
leaping
ability
His
ability
to
use
the
Force
push
technique
was
exceptional
as
he
was
able
to
use
it
to
blast
back
General
Grievous
dozens
of
meters
with
a
single
push
during
their
duel
A
short
time
later
he
was
even
able
to
hold
off
a
Force
blast
from
Anakin
Skywalker
during
their
duel
though
after
a
short
time
the
resulting
telekinetic
struggle
launched
both
of
them
across
a
room
Prior
to
his
exile
on
Tatooine
Yoda
instructed
him
on
how
to
communicate
his
late
master
Qui
Gon
Jinn
who
was
unable
to
visibly
manifest
as
a
spirit
due
to
his
incomplete
training
under
the
Force
Priestesses
Through
Jinn
Kenobi
eventually
learned
the
ability
to
manifest
his
consciousness
after
death
a
skill
he
would
later
put
to
good
use
to
guide
and
counsel
his
apprentice
Luke
Skywalker
during
the
Galactic
Civil
War
Other
abilitiesEdit
Obi
Wan
Kenobi
proved
himself
to
be
a
great
military
strategist
and
a
highly
studious
man
demonstrating
good
knowledge
on
galactic
history
or
conventions
of
war
like
the
Yavin
Code
He
personally
led
his
troops
to
many
famous
victories
during
the
Clone
Wars
and
his
persuasive
demeanor
earned
him
the
moniker
of
The
Negotiator
Despite
his
dislike
of
flying
Kenobi
was
an
excellent
pilot
During
the
Clone
Wars
he
led
many
attacks
from
the
cockpit
of
his
Jedi
starfighter
or
his
Jedi
interceptor
proving
to
be
an
outstanding
pilot
when
navigating
through
an
asteroid
field
in
pursuit
of
Jango
Fett
s
ship
and
evading
his
seismic
charges
unscathed
Kenobi
was
also
a
skilled
hand
to
hand
combatant
having
developed
enough
level
of
skill
in
unarmed
combat
so
as
to
compete
with
Pre
Vizsla
leader
of
the
Death
Watch
in
unarmed
techniques
though
he
outclassed
the
Mandalorian
in
lightsaber
technique
During
his
duel
with
Jango
Fett
on
Kamino
Kenobi
was
briefly
deprived
of
his
lightsaber
and
fought
the
bounty
hunter
in
unarmed
combat
Furthermore
while
he
preferred
lightsabers
Kenobi
was
an
excellent
marksman
as
demonstrated
during
his
time
as
Rako
Hardeen
in
Moralo
Eval
s
Box
Though
he
admitted
his
skills
were
rusty
Kenobi
could
read
hand
signals
accurately
enough
to
understand
Eeth
Koth
s
message
to
his
location
at
the
Saleucami
system
He
understood
many
languages
including
Galactic
Basic
Twi

and

Alec
was
not
very
fond
of
the
Star

universe
however
and
thought
that
the
series
was
fairy
tale
rubbish
He
disliked
very
much
to
be
associated
with
the
role
of
Kenobi
Obi

played
by
Ewan

in

James

in

as
well
as

In

Taylor
returned

was

In

Kenobi
was
voiced
by
Stephen
Stanton
However
The
Making
of
Star

The
Definitive
Story
Behind
the
Original
Film
stated
that
George
Lucas
originally
came
up
with
the
idea
of
having
Ben
die
to
which
Guinness
initially
objected
By
explaining
that
Ben
would
have
little
to
do
in
the
story
after
the
Millennium
Falcon
escaped
the
Death
Star
Lucas
convinced
him
to
allow
it
However
other
sources
indicate
that
the
idea
to
kill
off
Kenobi
came
from
Marcia
Lucas
after
her
husband
complained
he
was
unable
to
find
a
way
to
generate
tension
in
the
story
Obi
Wan
Kenobi
s
Force
ghost
was
originally
present
in
the
early
drafts
of
the
film
Star
Wars
Episode
VIII
The
Last
Jedi
but
director
Rian
Johnson
ultimately
decided
to
use
Yoda
s
Force
ghost
instead
adding
that
the
only
version
of
Obi
Wan
who
interacted
with
Skywalker
was
the
one
of
late
Alec
Guinness
and
having
Luke
interacting
with
Ewan
McGregor
s
Obi
Wan
would
have
felt
too
weird
as
Luke
never
met
Obi

during
his
younger
years

Ben
Kenobi
s
observation
of
LukeEdit
The
Korean
Star
Wars
LINE
Webtoon
features
a
short
story
about
Luke
Skywalker
s
childhood
According
to
the
comic
despite
Lars
effort
to
prevent
Luke
from
meeting
Kenobi
Luke
eventually
met
him
when
he
became
years
old
Skywalker
went
on
an
adventure
with
his
friend
Windy
riding
a
dewback
but
they
soon
encountered
a
sandstorm
and
both
lost
consciousness
When
Skywalker
awoke
there
was
a
krayt
dragon
nearby
sneaking
up
on
him
Just
as
the
dragon
attempted
to
attack
Kenobi
appeared
and
beheaded
the
giant
creature
When
Skywalker
asked
who
he
was
Kenobi
answered
that
his
name
was
Ben
Kenobi
and
revealed
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
Skywalker
s
father
Kenobi
took
Skywalker
and
Windy
back
to
their
village
meeting
Skywalker
s
uncle
Owen
Lars
Lars
thanked
him
for
bringing
Luke
back
safely
but
told
him
to
stay
back
from
the
kid
because
he
didn
t
want
to
put
Skywalker
in
danger
In
return
Kenobi
said
he
was
observing
Skywalker
and
claimed
that
the
Force
was
strong
in
him
telling
Lars
that
he
would
leave
the
farm
one
day
Lars
responded
that
the
Jedi
were
done
since
the
Republic
had
fallen
warning
him
once
again
to
never
visit
their
homestead
again
